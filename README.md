# Course-Project-1-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-link2matt
This repo is for the class "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project.

My script is called "run_analysis.R".  
For details on how this script works, please see comments within this script.

This R script "run_analysis.R" creates the data set in the file "tidy_data.txt."
For details on the variables see the code book in my repo.

The data in this project is activity tracking from a Samsung smartphone.
Here's a description of that project:
